    <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
    <p>A block-level element always start on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space( a margin) before and after the element <br>
    A block-level alement always take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). <br>
    Two commonly used block elements are: <strong>p</strong> and <strong>div</strong> </p>
    
    <p style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid blue;">Hello World</div>

    <p>The P and thr DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available(stretches out to the left and right as far it can).</p>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>An inline elemet does not start on a new line.<br>An inline only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

    <p>This is an inline <strong>span</strong> <span style="border: 1px solid red;">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary</p>
    <!-- An inline element cannot contain a block-level element! -->
