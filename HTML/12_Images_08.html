        The image is inserted using the <img> tag. 
        The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute

        The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map,
        and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

    <!--
        The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute
        The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute.

            A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

                rect - defines a rectangular region
                circle - defines a circular region
                poly - defines a polygonal region
                default - defines the entire region
