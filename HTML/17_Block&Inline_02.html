    <!--
        There are two display values: block and inline
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
        An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
        The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
        The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
