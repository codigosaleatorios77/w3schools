    <h1>Animations</h1>
    <h2>CSS Animations</h2>
    <p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.</p>
    <p>You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.</p>
    <p>To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.</p>
    <p>Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.</p>
    <h2>The @keyframes Rule</h2>
    <p>When you specify CSS styles inside the <strong>@keyframes</strong> rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.</p>
    <p>To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.</p>
    <p>The following example binds the "example" animation to the &lt;div&gt; element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the &lt;div&gt; element from "red" to "yellow":</p>
    <div id="animation-01"></div>
    <p> When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.</p>
    <p>The <strong>animation-duration</strong> property defines how long an animation should take to complete. If the <strong>animation-duration</strong> property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds).</p>
    <p>In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).</p>
    <p>It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.</p>
    <p>The following example will change the background-color of the &lt;div&gt; element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete:</p>
    <div id="animation-02"></div>
    <p>The following example will change both the background-color and the position of the &lt;div&gt; element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete:</p>
    <div id="animation-03"></div>

    <h2>Delay an Animation</h2>
    <p>The <strong>animation-delay</strong> property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.</p>
    <p>The following example has a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation:</p>
    <div id="animation-04"></div>
    <p>Negative values are also allowed. If using negative values, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for N seconds.</p>
    <p>In the following example, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for 2 seconds:</p>
    <div id="animation-05"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Set How Many Times an Animation Should Run</h2>
    <p>The <strong>animation-iteration-count</strong> property specifies the number of times an animation should run.</p>
    <p>The following example will run the animation 3 times before it stops:</p>
    <div id="animation-06"></div>
    <p>The following example uses the value "infinite" to make the animation continue for ever:</p>
    <div id="animation-07"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles</h2>
    <p>The <strong>animation-direction</strong> property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.</p>
    <p>The animation-direction property can have the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>normal </strong>The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default</li>
        <li><strong>reverse </strong>The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)</li>
        <li><strong>alternate </strong>The animation is played forwards first, then backwards</li>
        <li><strong>alternate-reverse </strong>The animation is played backwards first, then forwards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles. The following example will run the animation in reverse direction (backwards):</p>
    <div id="animation-08"></div>
    <p>The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles. The following example uses the value "alternate" to make the animation run forwards first, then backwards:</p>
    <div id="animation-09"></div>
    <p>The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles. The following example uses the value "alternate-reverse" to make the animation run backwards first, then forwards:</p>
    <div id="animation-10"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Specify the Speed Curve of the Animation</h2>
    <p>The <strong>animation-timing-function</strong> property specifies the speed curve of the animation.</p>
    <p>The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ease </strong>Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)</li>
        <li><strong>linear </strong>Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end</li>
        <li><strong>ease-in</strong>Specifies an animation with a slow start</li>
        <li><strong>ease-out</strong>Specifies an animation with a slow end</li>
        <li><strong>ease-in-out</strong>Specifies an animation with a slow start and end</li>
        <li><strong>cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)</strong>Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:</p>
    <div id="container">
        <div id="div1">linear</div>
        <div id="div2">ease</div>
        <div id="div3">ease-in</div>
        <div id="div4">ease-out</div>
        <div id="div5">ease-in-out</div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Specify the fill-mode For an Animation</h2>
    <p>CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.</p>
    <p>The <strong>animation-fill-mode</strong> property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).</p>
    <p>The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>none </strong>Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing</li>
        <li><strong>forwards </strong>The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)</li>
        <li><strong>backwards </strong>The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period</li>
        <li><strong>both </strong>The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following example lets the &lt;div&gt; element retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>
    <p>Let the div element retain the style values set by the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>
    <div id="animation-11"></div>
    <p>The following example lets the &lt;div&gt; element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts (during the animation-delay period):</p>
    <p>Let the div element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts (during the animation-delay period):</p>
    <div id="animation-12"></div>
    <p>The following example lets the &lt;div&gt; element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts, and retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>
    <p>Let the div element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts, and retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>
    <div id="animation-13"></div>

    <h2>Animation Shorthand Property</h2>
    <p>The example below uses six of the animation properties:</p>
    <div id="animation-14"></div>
    <p>The same animation effect as above can be achieved by using the shorthand animation property:</p>
    <div id="animation-15"></div>
